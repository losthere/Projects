					<li><b><u>Social Security Number Protection Policy.</u></b></li>
				</h2>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is
					important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we
					handle the information collected through the use of this website.
					Portions of this website may describe privacy practices applicable
					to specific types of information or to information provided on
					specific web pages.</p>
				<p>This policy does not apply to information collected through
					other means such as by telephone or in person, although that
					information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in
					this policy, terms such as "we" or "our" and "Company" refer to
					Optum and its current and future affiliated entities, including our
					parent company UnitedHealth Group.</p>
				<p>This website is intended for a United States audience. Any
					information you provide, including any personal information, will
					be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within
					the United States.</p>
				<h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
				<p>The Company uses various technologies, which may include
					"cookie" technology, to gather information from our website
					visitors such as pages visited and how often they are visited, and
					to enable certain features on this website. "Cookies" are small
					text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a
					website or click on a URL. Cookies may include "single-session
					cookies" which generally record information during only a single
					visit to a website and then are erased, and "persistent" cookies,
					which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are
					deleted or are set to expire.</p>
				<p>You may disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your
					browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your
					ability to take advantage of all the features on this website. You
					may also manage the use of "flash" technologies, with the Flash
					management tools available at Adobe's website. Note that we do not
					currently respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals that
					provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about
					online activities over time and across third-party websites or
					online services because, among other reasons, there is no common
					definition of such signals and no industry-accepted standards for
					how such signals should be interpreted.</p>
				<p>
					We may also allow third party service providers to use cookies and
					other technologies to collect information and to track browsing
					activity over time and across third party websites such as web
					browsers used to read our websites, which websites are referring
					traffic or linking to our websites, and to deliver targeted
					advertisements to you. We do not control these third party
					technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of
					third parties using such technologies. For more information about
					third party advertising networks and similar entities that use
					these technologies, see <a id="aboutadsConsumersID"
						href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>,
					and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising
					practices, go to <a id="aoutAdsChoicesID"
						href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
					Once you click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such
					advertising from all participating advertising companies or only
					advertising provided by specific advertising companies.

					aggregate data from our website visitors such as which pages are

					restricted by this policy or by law. Some examples of the ways we
