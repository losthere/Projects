					send the Company a notice requesting that the material be removed,
					or access to it blocked. This request should be sent to:
					DMCARegisteredAgent2@optum.com; or, alternatively to: UnitedHealth
					Group, Attn: DMCA Registered Agent, 9900 Bren Road East,

					behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
					infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to
					have been infringed; (c) identification of the material that is
					claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity; (d)
					the name, address, telephone number, and email address of the
					complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a
					good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained
					of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law;
					and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is
					accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party
					is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right
					that is allegedly infringed If you believe in good faith that a

					imposed by the DMCA. Notices and counter-notices with respect to
